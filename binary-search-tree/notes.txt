A binary search tree(BST), sometimes called ordered or sorted binary tree, is a type of node-based structure that uses a non-linear approach in organizing data unlike the linked lists.

Back in the linked list session, a linked list can have a head or a tail and its nodes can have a next or a previous pointer. In a binary search tree however, it has a root node that branches out into multiple nodes using a left or right pointer.
