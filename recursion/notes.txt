Recursions are alternative loops. A recursion is a programming pattern wherein a function calls itself. A function that uses this pattern is called a recursive function.

visualization for the else-if branch in our palindrome

for the example fiven we used the word "racecar"

 1st Iteration:

   r    a    c    e    c    a    r
  [0]  [1]  [2]  [3]  [4]  [5]  [6]
  x                              x

  return: It is a Match!

  2nd Iteration:

   a    c    e    c    a
  [0]  [1]  [2]  [3]  [4]
   x                   x

   return: Its a Match!

  3rd Iteration:
  
    c    e   c
   [0]  [1]  [2]
    x         x

 return: Its a Match!

  4th Iteration:
   
    e
   [0]

   return: It's a Palindrome
