    <title>WD034-04: Sentence Traversal</title>

  <body>
    <!-- lets include the script tag -->
    <script>
      // 1. lets declare a variable that will hold the value of the string we are trying to traverse.

      let text = "bootcamp";
      // 2. lets create a loop for the sentence traversal using "for" loop
      //   for (let i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {
      //     console.log(text[i]);
      //   }

      // 3. COnvert the loop into a recursive function call
      const rTextTraversal = (text) => {
        // 4. lets display the text that will be traversed
        console.log(text);
        console.log(text[0]);
        text = text.substr(1); //removes the first character inside the string

        // 5. lets create a contrl structure that will determine the length of the text and to determine when the recursive call will end.

        //base case
        if (text.length > 0) {
          rTextTraversal(text); //recursive call
        }
      };

      let message = "bootcamp";
      rTextTraversal(message);
    </script>

    <!-- WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
        
        -> The function called itself repeatedly until the "if" condition is no longer met

        -> after the recursive calls have ended, the code is then evaluated accordingly by multiplying the result of each recursive call.
             -> therefore, arriving at the same answer as we did in our for loop.

        WHICH ONE IS THE RECURSIVE CALL?
         -> rTraversal (text) -> because, it call itself.

         -> text.substr(1) -> reduces the length of the text so that eventually the base case inside the if condition will not be met.

        WhICH ONE IS THE BASE CASE?
         -> CONTROL STRUCTURE "if condition -> because it stopped the recursive call.

         What is the common use of "traversal" when it comes to app development
