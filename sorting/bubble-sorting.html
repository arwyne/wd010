        What is sorting?
            -> arrange systematically in groups; seperate according to type, class, etc.

        What is Bubble sorting?
            -> Bubble sorting is sometimes referred to as "Sinking sort"
            -> considered as the simplest sorting algorithm

        What is Iteration?
            -> is the act of repeating.
            -> can also refer to a process wherein a computer program is instructed to perform a process over and over again repeatedly for a specific number of times or until a specific condition is met.

            -> 1st parameter: specified where the execution of code will start, in this example it started at the outer left side of the array, indicating that we'll start at the 0 index a.k.a the first value in the array. we ended the expression with a semicolon.
            -> 2nd parameter: we need compare the length of the array indicating when the code will stop from executing.
            -> 3rd parameter: we indicated an increment that will continue the script if the condition is haven't met yet.

          /* the inner loop inside each iteration will go from one element to the next. (left to right) until the second to last element is reached,
                -> if the current element is bigger than the next element, the elements will "SWAP" or "SWITCH" places.
            */

                            -> the current element should be (>) greater than the nextElement.
                        if you want to arrange the elements in Descending order:

                    Additional notes during application:
                        -> always make sure to change the words in the statements in the iteration and comparison loops to properly describe the execution of the script.
                        -> we strongly recommend including the for loops that we included in the script above to help and guide you answer or describe the process of comparing and sorting data in an array during techinal exams.
