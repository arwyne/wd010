        What is Selection Sort?
            -> In this type of algorithm, it uses two arrays, The first array contains the original elements and the second array contains the sorted elements.

        How does it work?
            -> sorting in this algorithm is done by repeatedly identifying the smallest values/element in the first array, and extracting it from the first array and then putting it in a sequential manner on the 2nd array.

      /* 3. lets declare 3 variables
            -> 1st variable lets declare a series of elements/numbers inside an array, so in this example I named the first variable "original array" and it contains the array values it's original "unsorted" form.
            -> 2nd variable: lets declare a blank array that will soon contain the series of numbers in the first variable but this time in a "sorted manner".

            for this example we will be using while loop
